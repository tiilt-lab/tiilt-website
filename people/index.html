          <p>As a disabled researcher and educator, Meg is particularly interested in educational dignity. Her work seeks to challenge the deficit-based views of human learning that are complicit in the reification of normatively powered dynamics and push beyond the practices that maintain and enact ableism to a dynamic coexistence of multiple ways of seeing and knowing. She enjoys riding her bike, hanging out with animals, and eating Albanese gummy bears.</p>

          <p>I am a student in the Joint PhD program in Computer Science and Learning Sciences at Northwestern University. I am originally from Jackson, Mississippi and lived in Boston, Massachusetts for several years. The opportunity to do both computer science and learning sciences is what brought me to Northwestern. I was first introduced to computer science as a 2nd-year college student at Xavier University of Louisiana, a historically-Black university in New Orleans, Louisiana. After a master’s degree and years in STEM/ Computer Science educational outreach, I found my way into the classroom. I spent a few transformative years as a CS teacher before getting back into academia. Now, I want to work to address some of the key problems that surfaced while engaging in those spaces.</p>
