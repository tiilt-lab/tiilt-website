        <b>Multicraft + Tangicraft</b> works on multimodal interfaces to
        empower individuals with physical impairments to play and create in
        the popular video game Minecraft. Multicraft utilizes Gaze and Speech
        to replace the traditional mouse and keyboard interface. By looking at
        a location on the screen and uttering a command, users can build in
        the Minecraft world. Tangicraft utilizes tangible blocks with webcam
        detectable codes. Users can construct a physical structure in front of
        a webcam and call it in the Minecraft world by pressing a button on an
        Arduino microcontroller. Our team is currently conducting user tests
        to drive iteration on our initial designs.
