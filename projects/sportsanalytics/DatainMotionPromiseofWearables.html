			<h1> Week 2 Promise of Wearables <span><a class="box" href="index.html"> Go back ◀ </a></span> </h1>
			<p>Wearable technologies are showing up in many different places and for many different purposes. Take a look at these three videos that talk about how wearable technologies are being used in sports.

			<p>Here is one more video about using wearables in sports. It's an advertisement so we apologize if it seems gimmicky, because it is.

			</p>
			<p>Take a moment to journal about ways wearables are used in sports and any parts that seemed interesting, fun, or particularly strange.
			</p>
			<p>----
			</p>
			<h2>Activity 1:
			</h2>
			<p>In your kits you will find a Moov Now watch. Go ahead and take it out of the kit so that you can test it out.
			</p>
			<p>You will need to have the device wirelessly connect with a phone or iPad. The app is called Moov Coach.
			</p>
			<p>Once you have set up your account it's time to test out some of the activities available on the Moov Coach app. Pick a couple that seem interesting to you and give them a try. Some suggested activities include Brisk Walk, Cardio Boxing, 7 Minute+, or Open Running. These can all be done without additional equipment.
			</p>
			<p>After you've finished, take a moment to write in your Data in Motion journal.
			</p>
			<p>Review the Moov in your Data in Motion Journal:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How did the moov activities go? Which ones did you like and which did you dislike?</li>
				<li>What’s your general impression (vibe) of the Moov Now watch.</li>
				<li>How well does the watch band fit? </li>
				<li>Was the coaching from the moov useful?</li>
				<li>Did you think the device lived up to the advertising video?</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Activity 2:
			</h2>
			<p>Invite a family member or a friend to test out one of two of the activities using the Moov Now watch and do a short interview with them and their experience with the device. You can use the questions from Activity 1, and/or come up with your own! Take notes in your Data in Motion journal<a href="https://bit.ly/2JKa9l0">.</a></p>
