      <h1>Learning with Minecraft</h1>
      <p class="window__description">Many in the media and the academia have touted Minecraft as a hotbed of learning.
        <b>Learning with Minecraft</b> studies how children might learn spatial reasoning and programming skills within
        and
        around the game. We are currently conducting a comparative study of student collaboration under two conditions:
        1) Completing a construction task in a traditional Minecraft server; and 2) Using the MakeCode interface in
        Minecraft Education Edition. Additionally, we are using screen capture and eye tracking technologies to collect
        data and investigate spatial reasoning processes in Minecraft gameplay.

      <p class="window__description"><b>Multicraft + Tangicraft</b> works on multimodal interfaces to empower
        individuals with
        physical impairments to play and create in the popular video game Minecraft. Multicraft utilizes Gaze and
        Speech to replace the traditional mouse and keyboard interface. By looking at a location on the screen and
        uttering a command, users can build in the Minecraft world. Tangicraft utilizes tangible blocks with webcam
        detectable codes. Users can construct a physical structure in front of a webcam and call it in the Minecraft
        world by pressing a button on an Arduino microcontroller. Our team is currently conducting user tests to drive
        iteration on our initial designs.

      <p class="window__description"><b>IMR (Imagine, Make, Repeat)</b> works with educators to plan and implement
        Makerspace technologies and projects in classrooms
        and Makerspaces throughout Evanston and Chicago. IMR has appeared at STEMFest, YEA! festival,
        and
        has collaborated with Chute
        Middle School, MetaMedia at the Evanston YMCA, and the Evanston Public Library. Going forward,
        the
        IMR team looks to further
        develop and expand partnerships with educators and making communities across the Chicagoland
        area.

      <h1>Blinc</h1>
      <p class="window__description">This team works on developing data-capture devices
        that provide educators with
        real-time multimodal learning analytics. We use ReSpeaker Core v2.0 microphone arrays to show educators what
        keywords have been said, a discussion timeline, direction of speech, and emotional tone indicators. We are also
        working to incorporate body pose estimation into our analyses. We have tested our devices in multiple
        classrooms and are continuing development and testing in the coming months.

        <b>FamJam!</b> engages children and their families in a making, learning, and bonding experience.
        Over three sessions, families use low- and high-tech tools to create a game based on a family
        narrative or story. We seek to understand how we can meaningfully engage families in “making”
        activities both in facilitated makerspaces and at home.

      <h1>Sports Analytics</h1>
      <!-- <img class="lazy visually_hidden" alt="" src=""> -->
      <p class="window__description">
        Recent estimates suggest that 70% of youth participate in sports, whereas fewer than 20% participate
        in out-of-school STEM experiences. The Sports Analytics project imagines how unlocking new curiosities
        within athletes could transform the landscape of STEM learning, both in terms of who participates and
        types of innovations that emerge. In partnership with local organizations, we create learning environments
        where students are introduced to ways that technology can help them improve their athletic performance,
        and ways that sports can improve their understanding of STEM concepts. We provide participants the opportunity
        to explore statistical questions that are meaningful to them, with tools such as wearables, Python
        statistical packages, and R programming tools prominently used by data scientists.

        The Mekatilili Fellowship Program is a project in collaboration with the <a href="http://mekatilili.media.mit.edu/"
          target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" aria-label="Mekatilili Website">MIT Media
          Lab</a>. This project aims to support Kenyan students and professionals in developing
        technologies within the context of agriculture, accessibility, and design for
        manufacturing. We have partnered with three local Kenyan companies in order to allow
        the participants to design for real applications using the ESP8266 IoT boards and IBM
        Watson. The organizations work within the realms of accessibility, agriculture, and
        design for manufacturing. Some of the applications students began developing include
        auto-correcting humidity systems for growing crops, a system to save 3D print status in
        case of a power outage, and a stabilizing spoon. The aims of this project is to provide
        opportunities for students to apply their technical backgrounds in a real world setting
        and create lasting relationships with the local Kenyan partners to help support
        innovation.
