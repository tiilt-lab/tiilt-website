        individuals with
        physical impairments to play and create in the popular video game Minecraft. Multicraft utilizes Gaze and
        Speech to replace the traditional mouse and keyboard interface. By looking at a location on the screen and
        uttering a command, users can build in the Minecraft world. Tangicraft utilizes tangible blocks with webcam
        detectable codes. Users can construct a physical structure in front of a webcam and call it in the Minecraft
        world by pressing a button on an Arduino microcontroller. Our team is currently conducting user tests to drive
        iteration on our initial designs.

      <p class="window__description">Many in the media and the academia have touted Minecraft as a hotbed of learning.
        <b>Learning with Minecraft</b> studies how children might learn spatial reasoning and programming skills within
        and
        around the game. We are currently conducting a comparative study of student collaboration under two conditions:
        1) Completing a construction task in a traditional Minecraft server; and 2) Using the MakeCode interface in
        Minecraft Education Edition. Additionally, we are using screen capture and eye tracking technologies to collect
        data and investigate spatial reasoning processes in Minecraft gameplay.

        working to incorporate body pose estimation into our analyses. We have tested our devices in multiple
        classrooms and are continuing development and testing in the coming months.

        <b>Tinkering with Music</b> works closely with a local afterschool youth club to develop
        activities that marry making with music appreciation. Our team is conducting the second
        iteration of our curriculum Tinkering with Music. The curriculum invites middle school
        participants to build instruments and take part in collaborative active listening and
        discussion activities. Moreover, to promote prolonged engagement outside of the
        curriculum, we are developing a tangible exhibit for active listening and song annotation.

        In partnership with an organization in Evanston called Family Focus, Sports Analytics creates a
        learning environment for participants that merges data analytics, computational thinking, and
        sports. Our objective is to design a learning experience around different types of wearable
        technologies such as kits featuring conductive thread, LED lights, sensors and other components
        commonly found in high-tech garments. Participants will also work with, circuit boards that can
        be programmed to direct the various devices attached to them. Activities are designed such that
        students have access to data science tools such as Python statistical packages and R
        programming tools prominently used by data scientists. Providing participants, the opportunity
        to explore statistical questions that are meaningful to them and allow them to become creators of
        data science artifacts.

        The Mekatilili Fellowship Program is a project in collaboration with the <a href="http://mekatilili.media.mit.edu/"
          target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MIT Media
          Lab</a>. This project aims to support Kenyan students and professionals in developing
        technologies within the context of agriculture, accessibility, and design for
        manufacturing. We have partnered with three local Kenyan companies in order to allow
        the participants to design for real applications using the ESP8266 IoT boards and IBM
        Watson. The organizations work within the realms of accessibility, agriculture, and
        design for manufacturing. Some of the applications students began developing include
        auto-correcting humidity systems for growing crops, a system to save 3D print status in
        case of a power outage, and a stabilizing spoon. The aims of this project is to provide
        opportunities for students to apply their technical backgrounds in a real world setting
        and create lasting relationships with the local Kenyan partners to help support
        innovation.
