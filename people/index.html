          <img class="lazy" data-src="../assets/img/people/kit-martin copy.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Kit grew up in Sudan, a country in a civil war. From there he moved around a lot. These travels motivated
            him to notice the gross disparities. This motivation got him started working with disadvantaged youth in
            Nashville back in the ’90s and running a mentoring program in Upstate New York in the 2000s. This
            motivation has taken him into simulation through agent based models, especially models dealing with social
            systems that demonstrate the intersubjective development of inequality. Kit has an M.A. in international
            development and experience working overseas implementing field projects in loan provision, agricultural
            systems transformation and recycling efforts. Kit also has experience teaching biology, population dynamics
            and computer programming through ant based models in schools in Nashville, Tennessee with Vanderbilt. Kit
            is currently interested in multi-modal sensors. He sees them as a bridge between agent based methods and
            his other evaluations frameworks.</p>
